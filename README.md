Snort IDS Custom Rule Lab

Hands-on Snort IDS project using an attacker–defender setup with Ubuntu as the IDS host and Kali Linux as the attacker. Custom ICMP and TCP SYN scan detection rules were created, attacks were simulated using ping and Nmap, and real-time alerts were analyzed to validate detection accuracy.
